Consider why random data might still produce non-zero slopes and intercepts in regression:

    Especially when there is less data, it is not unlikely that the data has some pattern to it. If their x increases as their y increases,
    There will be a positive slope and an non-zero intercept that goes with that slope. As you increase the amount, this becomes
    less and less likely


Explain whatever you found interesting and your analysis. You can discuss any specific points or specific inputs you want to.

    I found it interesting that, with increased variance, it is unclear whether you will get a very high intercept or slope. It makes
    it very unpredictable.

Explain any patterns you observe and discuss what happens when the sample size or noise level changes.

    When the noise level increases, the plot is very hard to read. When sample size increases, it becomes much more normalized.
